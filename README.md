# Fashion Item Classification, Final Project for DS340

This repository contains the code and final report for the Fashion Item Classification project. The project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify fashion items into various categories and subcategories. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle Fashion Product Images dataset, and the project is aimed at improving the e-commerce retail experience by enabling precise and swift product classification.

The code is written in Python and primarily structured into several modules, with the notebook providing detailed steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The project implements various CNN architectures for different classification tasks, such as gender prediction, master category classification, subcategory classification, and seasonality prediction.

To run the code, ensure the dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and set up the environment with the necessary Python libraries. The final report, titled "Fashion Item Classification Final Report", provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset, CNN architectures, results, and conclusions, and is available in PDF format within the repository.

For more detailed information, please refer to the final report and the code available in the provided notebook.
